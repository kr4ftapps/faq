            This usually occurs if there is an interruption between your watch and phone while installing clock faces. Unfortunately, it appears to be fairly random and not limited to our clock faces. If you restart your watch and force quit the Fitbit app on your phone and try again, it should then install normally.
            </p>
          <p>
            If the "Clock Error" message happens by itself after using the clock face for a while, swapping to a different clock face then installing this clock face again should fix it.

            The Fitbit connection can be unstable when installing which can make things difficult. The best way to fix this issue is to hold all the button(s) on your watch until the Fitbit logo appears. While your watch is rebooting, turn your phone off and on again. After both devices turn back on, open the Fitbit app and sync and everything should work again.
            </p>
          <p>
            If that doesn't work and you're using the new Fitbit update, try to switch clocks using the Clocks app on your watch - this can force the app to finish switching or installing.

            This can happen after installing a Fitbit app update or when you install a new version of a clock face. Please go to your clock face in the Fitbit app, and toggle all the permissions off and on again.
            </p>
          <p>
            If that doesn't work, please install a different clock face, then install this one again.

            If you swap to another clock face and swap back to this one, it should fix any strange issues you may be having. Please also ensure you have the latest Fitbit app updates and installed any watch updates too.
            </p>
          <p>
            There is also a known Fitbit issue when updating the Fitbit app that can change your clock face permissions. Please go to your clock face in the Fitbit app, and toggle all the permissions off and on again.
            </p>

            Ultimately you can try the following:
            </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Restart your mobile phone Bluetooth (turn it off/on again)</li>
            <li>Sync your watch with Fitbit</li>
            <li>Reinstall the clockface (install a different one and then install it back)</li>
          </ul>
        </React.Fragment>
      )
    },
  ]
};

            After installing the clock face, a <strong>5-digit code</strong> will pop up on your watch.

          <p>
            Access the website shown on your watch <a href="https://kiezelpay.com/code/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(or click here)</a> and type the code in.

            Bundles are usually a great way of saving money. If a bundle is offered with a clock face, it will probably have a better value for money.
            </p>
          <p>
            Not every clock face is part of a bundle, but if the one you are purchasing is you will have the choice to opt in for the bundle during the payment.
            </p>
          <p>
            You can also purchase bundles directly from our website at:

            Definitely not, purchases are valid for a lifetime. Once you have purchased a clock face you will have it for as long as you want.

            Unfortunately Fitbit does not always allow us to recognize you again after (re)installing an app or clock face, so our system might think you are a new customer when that happens and might ask you to pay again.
          </p>
          <p>
            If that does happen, just access the <a href="https://kiezelpay.com/unlock" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">unlock feature</a>, type in your email and the <strong>5-digit code</strong> displayed and you will have access to the clock face again.
